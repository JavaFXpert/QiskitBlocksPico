QiskitBlocks minimized and flattened to run on Pico-8

QiskitBlocksPico is a Quantum computing game in which the object will be to exit a series of escape rooms by solving quantum circuit puzzles. This is currently in development, but you can play around with creating quantum circuits by doing the following:

1. Select a gate or tool from the popup menu (that appears when pressing the Enter key)

2. Place a gate on an empty white block in the circuit (using the X key or button), noting that the liquid levels and arrows in the block below the circuit change accordingly.

  - The liquid level indicates the probability that a given basis state will result when the circuit is measured.

  - The arrow direction indicates the phase of a given basis state, with 0 degrees denoted by a right-pointing arrow.

3. To convert an X gate into a controlled-X gate, while wielding a CTRL tool over an X block, press the X key or button.

Please reach out on Twitter @JavaFXpert if you have questions. I plan to continually add to the game so that it becomes a minimal 2D version of http://qisk.it/blocks
